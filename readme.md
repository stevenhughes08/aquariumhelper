"#Aquarium Helper" 

This is a long term project to solve the problem of making salt water for my reef tank and making the calculations less work. The formula may need to be tweaked over time to be more accurate.

The calculations provided by instant ocean are 1.5lbs per 5 gallons of water. From personal experience this is not always accurate and some physical research will need to be done.
